This project is a JavaFX application that simulates the Doppler effect between two moving entities. 
Both entities act as both the sound source and as the observers. As their positions and velocities change, the program calculates and displays the observed frequencies and wavelenths in real time.

The application also includes animations, UI transitions, various settings, and unit tests for the core model (DopplerModel and Entity classes). It was built as part of a course final project.
